# "Least Squares" developed by TheKoke
Is a project for recording and calculating experimental data from laboratory works on technical subjects.
Some math statistics mixed with my comprehension structure of WPF and MVVM.
Developed for Self Use and Experience.
First package was not uploaded to the GitHub, therefore source code was lost myself.
